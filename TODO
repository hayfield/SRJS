SRJS.Vision.detectBlobs()
 - Can create large numbers of span objects per frame. Possibly reuse to give the garbage collector some love.
 
SRJS.Vision.update()
 - Would make more sense to access image data directly rather than converting to PNG, drawing that, then getting imageData to process
 
Triggers
 - Should possibly be more integrated with the physics code
 
Physics
 - Using SRJS.phys seems a bit hacky
 - SRJS.intersections also seems a bit hacky
 - When calculating polygon intersections, if there's an intersection, the point is calculated a second time

Bump Sensors
 - Currently centred on the edge of the robot
 - Code duplicated between Bump Sensor and Range Finder

API
 - Try and make the input API slightly more like the Python version
 - Make it possible to specify the position and rotation of range finders (add your own)
