SRJS.Vision.detectBlobs()
 - Can create large numbers of span objects per frame. Possibly reuse to give the garbage collector some love.
 
SRJS.Vision.update()
 - Would make more sense to access image data directly rather than converting to PNG, drawing that, then getting imageData to process
 
Triggers
 - Should possibly be more integrated with the physics code

API
 - Implement other features
   - IO / 'bump switches'
   - Range finder
