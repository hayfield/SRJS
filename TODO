SRJS.Vision.detectBlobs()
 - Can create large numbers of span objects per frame. Possibly reuse to give the garbage collector some love.
 
SRJS.Vision.update()
 - Would make more sense to access image data directly rather than converting to PNG, drawing that, then getting imageData to process
 
Triggers
 - Should possibly be more integrated with the physics code

2011 Arena
 - Blue Blobs show through the wall from certain angles
 
Physics
 - Using SRJS.phys seems a bit hacky
 - SRJS.intersections also seems a bit hacky

Bump Sensors
 - Currently centred on the edge of the robot
 - Code duplicated between Bump Sensor and Range Finder

Robot Args
 - Specifying the width and length (so they're something other than 50) causes the bump sensors to be in the wrong place
 - Setting the height as anything other than 50 causes it to float

Query
 - Be able to combine both query and timeout events in a single yield without window.setTimeout() hacks
 - Make it possible to set a variable containing the results of the query - the first parameter to the callback.
 - See if the use of eval() can be reduced

API
 - Try and make the input API slightly more like the Python version
 - Make it possible to specify the position and rotation of range finders (add your own)

Pushing
 - Things should rotate when pushed
 - When doing SAT detection, project each vertex only once

Markers
 - Check whether the update system works with multiple robots, or whether markers need cloning when returning from update()

Robots
 - Add a specific section of the robot that picks things up rather than picking items up whether you drive straight forward into it or just clip it with the back corner

Features
 - Make robots push each other
 - Update the vision code to work like the new vision system when it arrives
